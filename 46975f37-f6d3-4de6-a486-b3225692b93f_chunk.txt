these waves, they have to become so great that the laws of physics that they're governed
by are no longer wave equations, but something more complicated and nonlinear.
And so in mathematical physics, we care a lot about whether certain equations in wave
equations are stable or not, whether they can create these singularities.
There's a famous, I saw a problem called the Navier Stokes-Rigularity problem.
So the Navier Stokes equations, equations that govern a fluid flow or incompressible
fluid is like water.
The question asks, if you start with a smooth velocity field of water, can it ever constrict
that you're going to have a smooth velocity field of water, can you start with a smooth velocity field of water, can you start with a smooth velocity field of water, can you start with a smooth velocity field of water, can you start with a smooth velocity field of water, can you start
