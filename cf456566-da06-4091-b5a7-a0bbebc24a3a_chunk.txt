Secretary Beasant, it's wonderful to see you.
Before we maybe deep dive into AI, do you want to give us the high level update on the
33 plan, how are things going?
You had an incredible clip by the way with Maria Bartiromo where you talked about some
of the things that were happening economically.
Maybe just levels that everybody on what's going on.
So just for good framing, during the campaign, I had a 333 plan.
I think it's my response off.
